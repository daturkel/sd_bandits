## Local Setup

Included in this repo are only the toy versions of the Deezer and OBD datasets.

It is recommended to download the full versions somewhere on your filesystem and then symlink them into this repo as follows:

```shell
$ cd data
$ ln -s ~/path/to/obd_full open_bandit_dataset
$ ln -s ~/path/to/deezer_full deezer_carousel_bandits
```
