    "# Deezer Dataset Loader\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the Deezer Dataset Loader (`sd_bandits.obp_extensions.dataset.DeezerDataset`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Deezer data comes with 974,960 users and 862 playlists. Both users and playlists have a 97-dimensional vector of features such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(u,i) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(- \\langle x_u,\\theta_i\\rangle)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_u$ is the user vector, $\\theta_i$ is the item vector, and $p(u,i)$ is the \"ground-truth\" probability of the user clicking the item (irrespective of its position).\n",
    "\n",
    "We want log data that could reasonably be the output of a random experiment with the Deezer data. In other words, if we show each user a completely random set of items, what will they click?\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the implementation from Deezer's own simulation code ([see here](https://github.com/deezer/carousel_bandits/blob/master/environment.py#L77)), we simulate 100 batches where 20,000 users are selected with replacement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each user is presented with `len_list=12` randomly selected items, and the $p(u,i)$ is calculated for each item. Then each probability is turned into a 0/1 reward outcome by simulating a Bernoulli random variable with $p=p(u,i)$. The rewards are tabulated using Deezer's cascading reward system:\n",
    "- If the user clicks none of the 12 items, we record the system as receiving 0 reward for each of the `len_init=3` items in the list, because we assume they only saw the first 3 items.\n",
    "- If the user clicks items $i_1,\\dots,i_j$, where $i_1$ is earliest and $i_j$ is latest the list, we record the 0/1 rewards for the first $\\max(l_{\\textrm{init}},i_j)$ items. **NOTE**: Deezer's code actually records the first $i_j$ rewards even if $i_j<l_{\\textrm{init}}$. We checked with Deezer and they acknowledged the simplification, noting it doesn't affect the results appreciably. We chose to follow the description in the paper.\n",
    "- (Optionally, we can choose to ignore the cascade rule and always record all `len_list` 0/1 rewards.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The relevant section from the paper is excerpted below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Simulations proceed as follows. At each [batch], a random subset of users (20 000, in the following) is presented to\n",
    "several sequential algorithms a.k.a. policies to be evaluated. These policies must then recommend an ordered set of\n",
    "L = 12 playlists to each user. Streams, i.e. positive binary rewards, are generated according to the aforementioned\n",
    "display-to-stream probabilities and to a configurable cascading browsing model capturing that users explore the carousel\n",
    "from left to right and might not see all recommended playlists. At the end of each [batch], all policies update their model\n",
    "based on the set of users and on binary rewards received from displayed playlists. Expected cumulative regrets of\n",
    "policies [2, 22, 39] w.r.t. the optimal top-L playlists sets according to pui probabilities are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> An active user who did not stream any card during the [batch] only saw the Linit first ones.\n",
    "• An active user who streamed the ith card, with i ∈ {1, ..., L}, saw all cards from ranks 1 to max(Linit,i).\n",
